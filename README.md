## Failing BASIC verdict

If you are failing basicIntegrity (SafetyNet) or MEETS_BASIC_INTEGRITY (Play Integrity) something is
wrong in your setup. My recommended steps in order to find the problem:

- Disable all modules except mine.
- Check your SELinux (must be enforced).

Some modules which modify system can trigger DroidGuard detection, never hook GMS processes.

## Certify Play Store and fix Google Wallet

Follow this steps:

- Flash my module in Magisk/KernelSU (if you already have my module, just ignore this step).
- Clear Google Wallet cache (if you have it).
- Clear Google Play Store cache and data.
- Clear Google Play Services (com.google.android.gms) cache and data (Optionally skip clearing data and wait some time, ~24h, for it to resolve on its own).
- Reboot

## Troubleshooting

### Fails to meet device integrity (KernelSU)

- Disable ZygiskNext
- Reboot
- Enable ZygiskNext

### Passes device integrity, but fails in Wallet (even after clearing cache)

- Remove all data from Google Play Services
